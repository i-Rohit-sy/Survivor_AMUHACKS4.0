# Chat Application - Detailed Project Report

## Description

### Project Overview

The Chat Application is a Java-based real-time communication system designed to facilitate instant messaging between multiple users over a local network. This project addresses the fundamental need for efficient, real-time communication in a simple and accessible format.

### Problem Statement

In today's digital age, while there are numerous sophisticated chat applications available, there's a need for a simple, lightweight, and educational chat system that:

1. Demonstrates core networking concepts
2. Provides a foundation for understanding client-server architecture
3. Offers a practical example of multi-threaded programming
4. Serves as a learning tool for Java socket programming

### Key Objectives

- Create a reliable real-time messaging platform
- Implement multi-client support
- Provide a simple and intuitive user interface
- Demonstrate proper handling of network connections
- Showcase thread management for multiple connections

## Proposed System

### System Architecture

The proposed chat application follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **Server Component**

   - Multi-threaded server implementation
   - Thread pool for managing client connections
   - Message broadcasting system
   - Connection handling and management

2. **Client Component**
   - User interface for message input
   - Real-time message display
   - Nickname management
   - Command processing system

### Technical Implementation

1. **Server Features**

   - Uses Java ServerSocket for network communication
   - Implements thread pool for efficient resource management
   - Handles multiple client connections simultaneously
   - Broadcasts messages to all connected clients
   - Manages client disconnections gracefully

2. **Client Features**
   - Connects to server using Socket programming
   - Provides command interface for user interaction
   - Supports nickname changes
   - Handles message sending and receiving
   - Manages connection state

### Key Functionalities

1. **Real-time Messaging**

   - Instant message delivery
   - Broadcast to all connected clients
   - Message formatting with sender identification

2. **User Management**

   - Custom nickname support
   - User join/leave notifications
   - Nickname change functionality

3. **Command System**
   - `/nick` command for changing nickname
   - `/quit` command for disconnecting
   - Extensible command structure
